If it needs an item to recharge then GreenGrocer will give you a sickle to harvest plants that you can earn food from him with. Blow the wall, and hopefully find a sheep, and finish when you do." },

After 4 Firespits or 1 throwing move connects with the door, it will crumble. Hit the pot hatch inside. You may need to take your Mamools out of the room for a moment, just to confirm if Brujeel is inside. If so, dialogue will appear and the mission will end shortly after. If not, go to the next door and repeat til you find Brujeel. Try not to kill too many Mamools as they do not respawn." },

There's no easy way to do this one other than just grab the jewel and navigate while avoiding the Mamool Ja. The Mamool Ja will chase you when you they spot you and you possess a jewel. You only need 1 Jewel Returned to the NPC to complete this mission. Best done with groups on this one if possible but can be solo'd" },

Once you have obtined a mine, engage a Brittle Rock and use the temporary item. Stay engaged until the device detonates and the rock will be destroyed in a single blast.
